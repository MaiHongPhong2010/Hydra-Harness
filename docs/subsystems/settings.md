# User Settings

The user-settings seam of [@hydraharness/harness-settings](../../packages/settings/settings) holds one user-owned document of per-namespace sections and resolves each registered namespace as schema defaults, then the registrant's composition `base`, then the user section. Providers such as [@hydraharness/harness-settings-file](../../packages/settings/settings-file) store the raw document and push external edits; consumer plugins register a schema and read or observe the resolved value. Composition config stays in `cordis.yml` — a namespace carries only the user-editable subset.

Source: [`packages/settings/settings/src/index.ts`](../../packages/settings/settings/src/index.ts)

## Identity

A namespace names one plugin-owned section of the user document. The brand prevents callers from mixing settings namespaces with other ids passed between packages or processes; construction validates lowercase kebab-case syntax.

```ts type-equiv
/** Nominal id of one registered settings namespace. */
type SettingsNamespace = Branded<'SettingsNamespace'>
```

## Registration

Registration binds a schemastery schema to a namespace on the calling plugin's fiber — disposing that fiber removes the namespace and its observers. The options carry the composition layer, the owner's effect timing, and an optional check for what the schema cannot express.

```ts type-equiv
/** Registration options beyond the namespace schema. */
interface SettingsRegisterOptions<T> {
  /** Composition-layer values resolved below the user layer (entry-config subset). */
  base?: Partial<T>
  /** Owner's effect timing, surfaced to configuration UIs; defaults to `live`. */
  applies?: SettingsApplies
  /**
   * Reject a resolved section the owner could not act on, for constraints its
   * schema cannot express — a cross-field requirement, or one field's validity
   * depending on another's. Throwing here refuses the *write* that produced the
   * value, so a caller learns at `update`/`replace`/`mutate` instead of storing
   * something that would silently disable the owner.
   *
   * Kept separate from the schema because the schema is also what a
   * configuration surface renders and what an absent section resolves through;
   * folding a cross-field check into it would change both.
   *
   * Once the owner is registered, a stored section that fails this keeps the
   * namespace's last good value and warns, exactly as a schema failure does,
   * so an externally edited document cannot strand a running owner. At
   * registration there is no last good value yet, so a stored section that
   * already fails rejects the registration itself — again exactly as a schema
   * failure does.
   * @param value - the resolved section, schema-valid by construction.
   */
  validate?: (value: T) => void
}
```

`validate` runs after the schema admits a value, so it sees defaults and the composition base exactly as the owner will. `@hydraharness/harness-llm-pi-ai` uses it to refuse a provider profile it could not serve at the write that produced it, rather than storing one that would disable every route in its namespace.

`applies` is a UI hint, not a mechanism: a `restart` owner simply never watches, so its value is read once at construction and configuration surfaces can badge the pending change.

```ts type-equiv
/** When a namespace's changes take effect for its owner. */
type SettingsApplies = 'live' | 'restart'
```

## Owner scope

The scope is the owner-facing handle. `update` merges a sparse patch over the user section only (never into `base`); `replace` sets the section wholesale, which is the removal/reset path — keys absent from the replacement re-inherit `base` and schema defaults. Writes to one namespace are serialized in call order, and resolved values are deep-frozen snapshots.

```ts type-equiv
/** Owner-facing handle for one registered namespace. */
interface SettingsScope<T> {
  /** Current user-section revision, sent as `expectedRevision` when writing a value derived from {@link get}. */
  readonly revision: number
  /** Current resolved value: schema defaults, then `base`, then the user layer. */
  get(): T
  /**
   * Observe committed changes to this namespace's resolved value. Invocations
   * of one callback run asynchronously, one at a time, in commit order; a
   * rejection is contained and logged like a sync throw. After the disposer
   * returns, no further invocation starts — one already queued is skipped;
   * one already started still settles, and service disposal waits for it.
   * @param callback - invoked after each commit with the next and previous values.
   * @returns the disposer removing this observer.
   */
  watch(callback: (next: T, prev: T) => void | Promise<void>): () => void
  /**
   * Merge a partial patch into this namespace's user layer and persist it.
   * @param patch - plain-object patch over the user section; JSON-compatible data
   * only (non-JSON values reject with their path before anything persists).
   */
  update(patch: object): Promise<void>
  /**
   * Replace this namespace's user section wholesale; absent keys re-inherit
   * the composition `base` and schema defaults (`replace({})` resets all).
   * @param section - the complete next user section; JSON-compatible data only,
   * as for {@link update}.
   */
  replace(section: object): Promise<void>
}
```

## Descriptors

`describe()` serializes every registered namespace for configuration surfaces: the schemastery `toJSON()` envelope drives schema-rendered forms, the resolved value fills them, and the detached `base`/`user` layers let a form mark user-overridden fields by presence. `describe({ redactSecrets: true })` — mandatory on every wire surface — strips `role('secret')` fields from all three layers and enumerates their `{path, set}` slots so a page can render write-only inputs without ever receiving a secret.

```ts type-equiv
/** One registered namespace as surfaced to configuration UIs. */
interface SettingsDescriptor {
  /** The registered namespace. */
  ns: SettingsNamespace
  /** Serialized schemastery schema (`schema.toJSON()`). */
  schema: unknown
  /** Current resolved value. */
  value: unknown
  /**
   * Monotonic revision of the raw user section this descriptor was read at.
   * Send it back as `expectedRevision` on a write to refuse a stale one.
   */
  revision: number
  /** Lower resolved parent value or registrant's composition `base` (detached), when declared. */
  base?: unknown
  /**
   * Raw user section from the stored document (detached), when one exists and
   * is well-formed; a field's presence here is what marks it user-overridden.
   */
  user?: unknown
  /** Owner's declared effect timing. */
  applies: SettingsApplies
  /** Schema-declared secret positions; present only under `redactSecrets`. */
  secrets?: RedactedSecret[]
}
```

A caller that holds only the redacted descriptor cannot safely rebuild a section, so removals travel as path ops instead. Each descriptor also carries a `revision` over the raw section; a write may send it back as `expectedRevision`, and one that no longer matches is refused rather than applied over the writer that landed first.
```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One path-addressed edit to a namespace's user section. Path mutation exists
 * for a caller holding an INCOMPLETE view of the section — a configuration UI
 * reads the redacted descriptor, which by construction never received the
 * `role('secret')` fields. Such a caller can name the field it means without
 * restating the section: a wholesale `replace` rebuilt from a redacted
 * document silently deletes every secret the wire never returned.
 */
type SettingsPathOp =
  | { op: 'set'; path: readonly string[]; value: unknown }
  | { op: 'unset'; path: readonly string[] }
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Options for {@link SettingsProvider.describe}. */
interface SettingsDescribeOptions {
  /**
   * Strip `role('secret')` fields from `value`/`base`/`user` and enumerate
   * them in each descriptor's `secrets`. Every wire surface MUST pass this;
   * the verbatim default exists for same-process configuration UIs only.
   */
  redactSecrets?: boolean
}
```

## Inherited providers

`inherit(parent, namespaces)` mirrors an explicit subset of a lower provider's registrations, resolved values, schemas, validators, and effect timing. A child owner can claim each inherited registration once; its raw section overrides the parent's resolved value without changing the parent document. Parent writes and registrations propagate to descendants, and inherited descriptors expose the lower resolved value as `base`.

`setLayerEnabled(false)` suppresses raw overrides in effective reads while retaining them in descriptors and on disk. Writes still validate the proposed section. Workspace configuration uses this to keep untrusted project files editable without executing their settings. `observe()` lets configuration transports refresh on raw, resolved, registry, and inherited descriptor changes; consumer `watch()` callbacks retain their ordered asynchronous semantics.

## Change commits

Every committed change — an in-process write or an externally observed provider edit — emits `settings/updated (ns, next, prev, source)` after the new value is authoritative, and never when the resolved value is deep-equal. The source tag separates the two entry paths.

```ts type-equiv
/** Origin of one committed settings change. */
type SettingsUpdateSource = 'update' | 'provider'
```

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `settings/*` events

<a id="settingsdocument-updated--emit"></a>

#### `settings/document-updated` — emit

One registered namespace's RAW user section changed, whether or not the resolved value did. `settings/updated` is the consumer-facing event and stays deep-equal-gated; this one exists for configuration surfaces, which must learn that a field went from inherited to overridden (same resolved value, different meaning) and that their held revision is stale. Listener containment matches `settings/updated`. The emitting provider is the Cordis receiver for service-realm routing.

```ts cordis-catalog

Committed change to one registered namespace's resolved value, after the provider persisted (for `update`) or published (`provider`) the change; never emitted when the resolved value is deep-equal.

Listener failures are contained and logged — a sync throw and an async rejection alike — except `INVARIANT`-coded failures, which rethrow after every listener ran; that rethrow reaches the emitter only from synchronous listeners, so invariant checks on this event must not be async functions.

The [client Settings plugin](../../packages/client/ui-settings/README.md) declares section owner props. The shell handles navigation; registrants own their data and mutations.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Owner share of a settings section entry. The shell owns modal visibility
 * and navigation; a section's data arrives through its own inject faces and
 * stores. Sections can close the panel or navigate to another registered page.
 */
interface SettingsSectionOwnerProps {
  /** Settings navigation search; General filters its registered row labels. */
  query?: string
  /** Close the settings panel (the shell owns the open state). */
  close: () => void
  /** Open a registered section, clear navigation search, and focus its heading. */
  openSection: (id: string) => void
}
